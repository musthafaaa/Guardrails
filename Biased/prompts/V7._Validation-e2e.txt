# `V0.validation.txt` â€” Self-Healing Prompt Validator

## **Objective**

Continuously validate and enforce all requirements from the following prompt files until the application fully meets **100% of expectations**:

* `V1.1_Language-specific.txt`
* `V1.2_Common-guidlines.txt`
* `V2.business-flow.txt`
* `V3.Quality-Guardrails.txt`
* `V4.post-generation.txt`
* `V6_generate-open-api-spec-swagger.txt`

---

## **Validation Rules**

1. **Strict Inclusion**

   * Every instruction from all prompt files must be implemented.
   * No instruction, word, or directive may be excluded, rephrased, or skipped.

2. **Recursive Enforcement**

   * After generation, perform a **full validation pass** against all prompts.
   * If any requirement is missing, immediately **regenerate or fix the output**.
   * Continue validating and regenerating until nothing is excluded.

3. **Automatic Correction**

   * On each failed validation:

     * Identify the exact missing or diluted instruction.
     * Re-apply it into the current application output.
     * Re-run validation again.

4. **Never Stop Until 100%**

   * The process must not stop or exit early.
   * The application is only considered complete when **all instructions are fully satisfied**.

## **Completion Criteria**

* The application **must incorporate every detail** from all six prompt files.
* Validation continues in a **loop** until no exclusions remain.
* Final state = **100% compliance** with all prompt instructions.
